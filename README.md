# LevelUp
Some interesting levels

#  Roaming around some logics may be easy for some but done for py

# level1.py
- prime or not checking 
- main() and calling user function and infinity loop 
- solving up for restoring 

* logic
* just main() calling user function() and user function starts
* with try :
  - input from user
*  logic that n==1 that neither prime nor not.
  - n>1 for i in range (2,n)
  - if(n%1 ==0) not prime and else prime and valueError print invalid number :
* calling main() to run it in actual >
* The end


# level2.py
- Fibonacci of series upto n 
- main ()
- range fixed asked from user
- and

*Logic
a=0,b=1 and c
c=a+b
a=b
b=c
** I have printed a and b and range (2 ,n) for logic


# level3.py
- Factorial of number
- main() and input from user.
- range fixed i (2,n)
- and

*Logic
if n==0 and n==1 
return 1 
as factorial of 0! = 1!
and so on


# level4.py
- palindrome number
- Mirror number reversing it gives the same look
- asked fro user input
- such as 121
- and

*Logic
starts with temp=n storing original number and 
rev-0 for reverse number storage 
if n>0:
digit=n%10
rev=rev*10+digit
n=n//10
if temp==rev palindrome ( reversed ) 
and else for no.
end 


# level5.py
- Armstrong number
- sum of cubics that means 153 = true armstrong number
- 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
- 153
- input from user

*Logic 
temp=n original number storage 
sum=0 for sum of cubics
and if n>0:
digit=n%10
sum=sum+ digit**3
n=n//10
and if temp==sum that concludes for its amstrong number 
and not 
end 


These some problems with solving !!
Take it for reference learners
